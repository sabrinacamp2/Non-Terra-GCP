- start_vm.sh: This script will start port forwarding in the background and start an interactive session of your GCP VM. 
- start_interactive.sh: This script will start an interactive session of your GCP VM. This would be useful if the port is already being forwarded (you already ran start_vm.sh earlier) but your interactive session was interupted or you exited out of the terminal. This will start another interactive session in the terminal. If you want to look at the jupyter notebook session that you previously put in a screen, you can then run screen -r jupyter_notebook.
- restart_port_forwarding.sh: If you connection ended on your jupyter notebook, it's possible that your port forwarding in the background stopped. You can restart the port forwarding using this script, and then reload the notebook in the browser.
